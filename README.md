This project contains an algorithm that, given the cards of two players, calculates how many rounds it took a player to win the game. Basically, the algorithm simulates a two-players [Beggar-My-Neighbour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beggar-my-neighbour) game.  
I want to find an infinite game: this happens when, after some rounds, the deck of both players is equal to the one they had at the start. But since there are [~10^20 possible games](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2688331/beggar-my-neighbour-possible-games), I can't test all of them, so I want to use evolution to get longer games and maybe find an infinite one
